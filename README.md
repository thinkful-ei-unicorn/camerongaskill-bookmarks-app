The user can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain: title, url link, description, rating (1-5)

The user can see a list of my bookmarks when they first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
The user can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
The user can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

The user receives appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

The user can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
